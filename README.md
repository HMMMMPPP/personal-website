# My Interactive 3D Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! Instead of a traditional 2D site, I'm building an immersive and interactive 3D experience where you can explore my work and learn more about me.

## üåü About The Project

This project is a personal portfolio reimagined as an interactive 3D world. The central idea is to have a main 3D model (or scene) that users can interact with. Different parts of the model will link to my projects, skills, resume, and contact information, creating a fun and engaging user journey.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive 3D Model:** A central scene built with React Three Fiber that users can rotate, pan, and zoom.
- **Embedded Content:** Clickable hotspots on the model reveal information about my projects, skills, and experience.
- **Animated Storytelling:** Engaging animations guide users through my professional story.
- **Responsive Design:** The 3D experience works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Performance Optimized:** Carefully optimized for fast load times and a smooth frame rate.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

Here are some of the features and improvements I have planned for the future:

- [ ] Add more complex 3D models for each project showcase.
- [ ] Implement a "game mode" to navigate the scene like a first-person character.
- [ ] Integrate a blog that can be accessed from within the 3D scene.
- [ ] Add more detailed animations and sound effects for interactions.
